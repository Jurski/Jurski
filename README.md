# Hi there, I'm Juris! ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate backend developer with a specialization in PHP. My skill set includes a deep understanding of PHP, MySQL, Laravel, Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a strong grasp of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, and SOLID principles, all of which guide me in crafting efficient, scalable, and maintainable code.

With an early fascination with computers and the internet, I transitioned from a career in e-commerce to programming. This shift was driven by a desire to not only understand digital solutions but also to build and optimize them, leveraging my business insights and technical knowledge.
